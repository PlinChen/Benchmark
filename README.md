This project is a set of scenes which aim to stress different parts of the Unity engine and to calculate a score.

It has been used to compare browsers performance when running Unity WebGL content. The results were puslished as Unity blog posts (most recent to oldest):

* [WebAssembly Load Times and Performance](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/09/17/webassembly-load-times-and-performance/)
* [Updated WebGL Benchmark Results](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/15/updated-webgl-benchmark-results/)
